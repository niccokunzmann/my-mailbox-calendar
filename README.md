My Mailbox Calendar
===================

Create an online calendar by inviting this application to your events:
1. Invite the mailbox calendar to your events, replacing TEST with a
   name of your liking:
   [my.mailbox.calendar+TEST@gmail.com](mailto:my.mailbox.calendar+test@gmail.com).
2. View that the event is actually being processed. Here, also replace
   TEST with the name you chose before:  
   https://my.mailbox.calendar.quelltext.eu/TEST.html
3. Subscribe to the calendar with any application using ICS.
